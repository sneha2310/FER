<p><b>3.Tensorflow: </b></p>
<p>TensorFlow is an open source library for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning. TensorFlow was originally developed for large numerical computations without keeping deep learning in mind.</p>
<p><b>4. CNN: </b></p>
<p>It  is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery. ... Convolutional networks were inspired by biological processes in that the connectivity pattern between neurons resembles the organization of the animal visual cortex.</p>
