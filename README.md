# FACE EMOTION RECOGNITION
Facial emotion recognition is the process of detecting human emotions from facial expressions.
The human brain recognizes emotions automatically, and software has now been developed that can recognize emotions as well. 
This technology is becoming more accurate all the time and will eventually be able to read emotions as well as our brains do.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Three basics problems need to be solved:
    1. Face detection
	  2. Facial expression data extraction
	  3. Facial expression classification
  
# SOLUTION
 1. Face detection is done using haarcascade_frontalface_default file
 2. Providing sufficient dataset and training our convolutional model helps building a efficient model
 3. After training our model is able to detect emotions with an accuracy of 61%

# TECHNOLOGY USED
  1. OpenCV
  2. Keras
  3. Tensorflow
  4. Numpy
  5. CNN

# APPLICATIONS
  1. Automatic Attendance System
  2. Security Purposes.
  3. Computer Interaction etc
